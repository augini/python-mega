# What is a process and a thread ?
# What is the difference between them ?

# Processes
# Process is an instance of a program. (Python interpreter, browser tab)

# Advantages
# Seperate memory space -> Memory is not shared between processes
# Great for CPU-bound processing
# New process is stated independently from other processes
# Processes are interruptable / killable
# One GIL for each process -> avoids GIL limitation 


# Disadvantages
